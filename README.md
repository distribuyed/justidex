## **DECENTRALIZATION GRADE**:

It is a complex task, since it not only requires a very specific technical definition, but also requires an exhaustive analysis of each of the exchanges that we include. We are working on it. But all help is welcome. The goal is to get a model like the Creative Commons badges [https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/licensing-examples/](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/licensing-examples/).

This is just a draft written by [Hanni Abu](https://github.com/HanniAbu), [Steven Hatzakis](https://github.com/hatgit), [Manfred Karrer](https://github.com/ManfredKarrer) and [Elio Osés](https://twitter.com/oseselio):

 - **Accountless**: The project should be accesible without registration, KYC or AML policies. `ACL`
 - **Decentralized Client**: The trades should be possibles through a downloadable client or build it from source. `DC`  
 - **Decentralized Development**: The project should be open source. `DD` 
 - **Decentralized DNS**: The project should be accessible through a decentralized domain name service (like [ENS](https://ens.domains/)). `DDNS` 
 - **Decentralized Governance**: The direction of the project should be governed by the project's service providers. `DG`
 - **Fully Decentralized**: `FULLY`
 - **Open Protocol**:   `OPRO`
